* Straw Poll

** Description

This full-stack app allows users to create polls, share their polls on twitter, vote for their favorite option, add their own options, and delete their own polls. I built the back-end with Node, Express, and MongoDB/Mongoose. The front-end uses Flotr, a lightweight chart library, to visualize poll results. I used Passport for user authentication and authorization. 

** Installation and Demonstration

This app is currently deployed at: https://strawpoll-fugalfunkster.c9users.io/

+This app is no longer deployed, and this repo does not contain a required .env file.
Github OAuth keys are required to run this app. I can spin this up on Cloud9 by request.+
